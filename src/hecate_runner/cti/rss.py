"""RSS/Atom CTI provider.

Polls a configured list of security research feed URLs, filters for entries
within a max age, and returns the oldest unrouted candidate across all
feeds as a ``CTIItem``. Unlike OTX's crowdsourced pulse firehose (which
needs TLP + ATT&CK-mapping filters to separate signal from noise), the
"high signal" filter here is mostly the curation itself: every feed in the
configured list is a hand-picked, reputable CTI research source, not an
open subscription firehose. A MITRE technique ID is still extracted from
the title/summary when present (same regex the orchestrator already uses
to seed research topics) so it can ride along as structured metadata, but
its absence doesn't exclude an entry — plenty of good tradecraft writeups
describe TTPs in prose without citing a T-code.

No structured indicators, deliberately. MISP and OTX both populate
``metadata["indicators"]``; this provider does not, and that is a decision
rather than an omission. Measured against the configured feeds: across 30
live entries from 5 feeds, the summaries contained zero IPs, zero hashes and
zero domains (two CVEs in total) -- a feed summary is an abstract, not an
indicator list, so there is nothing to extract.

The indicators do exist in the *linked article*, and defanging (``evil[.]com``,
``hxxp://``) would make them cheap to extract precisely -- an author defangs a
string exactly when they mean "this is an indicator", and no publisher defangs
its own domain. Measured on six live articles, five carried 5-35 defanged
indicators with no publisher-infrastructure false positives.

That is not implemented because it would mean this runner making outbound
requests to arbitrary third-party URLs that a feed points at, which is a
network-posture decision that was taken deliberately against. Naive extraction
without defanging is worse than nothing: one article yielded 21 "domains" that
were mostly the publisher's own navigation and CDN links, which would have
become Sigma rules matching the publisher.

The consequence to expect: RSS-sourced hunts derive their data sources from
ATT&CK techniques alone, and their grounding audits show fewer ``asserted``
claims than MISP-sourced ones. That is the source being honestly poorer in
checkable facts, not a defect in the pipeline.

Cursor state (the set of already-routed entry IDs per feed URL) is
persisted to disk so repeat polls don't re-ingest an entry, and a crash
mid-cycle doesn't lose position. Unlike OTX's incremental "modified since"
API sync, RSS/Atom feeds return their full current window on every
request with no server-side cursor — so, unlike OtxCursorState, a single
last-seen ID per feed isn't enough: only one candidate is acknowledged per
poll cycle (the globally oldest across all feeds), so a feed with several
unrouted entries has older ones routed one at a time across many cycles,
and the single last-seen ID gets overwritten — and its previous value
forgotten — every time a newer entry in the same feed is later
acknowledged. The full per-feed seen-ID set avoids that. Each feed's
failure (network error, malformed XML, blocked request) is isolated — one
broken feed doesn't stop entries from other configured feeds being
considered.
