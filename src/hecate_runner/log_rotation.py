"""Size-based rotation for a log file that has two independent writers.

``logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`` is the obvious tool here and is the
wrong one. It rotates by *renaming* the live file, which is only safe when the
rotating process is the sole writer. This log is not:

    StandardOutput=append:/…/logs/orchestrator.log
    StandardError=append:/…/logs/orchestrator.log

systemd opens that file itself when the unit starts and holds the descriptor
for the life of the run. A rename moves the inode out from under it, so
everything systemd writes for the rest of that run lands in the archive while
Python writes to the new file -- output split across two files with no error.

So this rotates the way logrotate's ``copytruncate`` does: copy the contents
aside, then truncate the original **in place**, keeping the inode. Both
writers' descriptors stay valid and simply continue at the start of the
now-empty file. Both open with ``O_APPEND`` (systemd's ``append:`` and
logging's mode ``"a"``), so neither leaves a sparse gap after the truncation.

The trade-off copytruncate always carries: anything written between the copy
and the truncate is lost. That window is microseconds, and it is bounded to a
rotation that happens once per several thousand hourly runs.
