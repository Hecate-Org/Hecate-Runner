"""Shared atomic-write helper for the small JSON state files this project
persists (orchestrator quota state, CTI cursor state, pending queries).

Plain `path.write_text(...)` writes in place -- if the process is killed
mid-write (systemd's `TimeoutStartSec=900` sends SIGKILL on timeout, and any
of these files could be mid-write at that moment), the file is left
truncated or partially overwritten. Most of these files already tolerate
that via a JSONDecodeError-triggers-a-reset fallback, but a reset silently
loses real state (the day's draft count, a CTI cursor position, a pending
query) rather than failing loudly -- write-to-temp-then-rename avoids the
corruption case entirely: `os.replace` is atomic on POSIX, so a reader only
ever sees the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial
one.

    its owner rather than matching the 0o644 a plain write_text() produces
    under the service's umask. Callers that want ordinary file permissions
