"""Re-audit hunt files that already exist on disk.

The grounding audit runs while a hunt is being drafted, which leaves every
hunt written before a given version of the audit graded by an older one — or,
for anything drafted before the audit existed, not graded at all. This module
is the retrospective half: read a finished hunt, recover the evidence it was
built from, and grade it again.

The recovery is the delicate part, and it is deliberately dull. A throwaway
regex written to do this ad hoc silently matched nothing and reported a fully
grounded hunt as having zero asserted claims — a false clean bill of health,
which is worse than no audit. So the parsing here scans line by line, returns
explicitly empty results rather than guessing, and is tested against the real
file shape.
