# Hecate Platform Architecture

An architectural blueprint of the Hecate autonomous detection engineering and threat hunting platform.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Hecate** is an autonomous, agentic detection engineering ecosystem. It bridges the gap between raw Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and production-grade detection content across modern Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms.

Hecate is designed around a core tenet: **The LLM proposes, deterministic code disposes.** Generative AI models propose hypotheses, extract threat behaviors, and draft candidate detection logic; deterministic static analysis engines, AST validators, MITRE ATT&CK grounders, and telemetry emulators verify, tune, and test every generated artifact before it reaches human review or production promotion.

---

## 2. The Three-Repository Topology

The platform is partitioned into three distinct repositories with decoupled responsibilities:

    end

## 3. End-to-End Lifecycle & Data Flow

From the arrival of an external intelligence pulse to a verified SIEM detection query in production, Hecate runs a multi-stage deterministic pipeline:

## 4. Key Subsystem Architectures

### 4.1 Autonomous Daemon & Dual-Track Queue

The perpetual daemon ([`hecate_runner.orchestrator`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/orchestrator.py)) runs as a resilient systemd background service (`hecate-runner-daemon.service`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    POLL["Poll Active CTI Feeds"] --> DUAL{"Classify Feed Type"}
    DUAL -- "Pure Indicators / High-Velocity" --> SWEEP["Fast Sweep Track<br/>Short Cooldown (30s)<br/>Deterministic Generator"]
    DUAL -- "Narrative Threat Intel / Reports" --> DEEP["Deep Research Track<br/>Standard Cooldown (180s)<br/>Agentic Research & Hypothesis"]
    SWEEP --> EMULATE["Purple Team Emulation & Review"]
    DEEP --> EMULATE
    EMULATE --> DRAFT["Write Draft Hunt & Queries"]
    DRAFT --> SYNC["Outbox PR Dispatch & Slack Notice"]
```

- **Dual-Track Priority:** High-volume indicator feeds (e.g. ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar) bypass heavy LLM research and invoke fast deterministic sweeps, preserving LLM token budgets and Tavily search credits for complex narrative advisories.
- **State Persistence:** Feed cursor positions, processed pulse IDs, and daily quotas are atomically committed to `.cursors/` and `.orchestrator_state.json`.

### 4.2 Grounding & Anti-Hallucination Framework

To guarantee detection fidelity, Hecate enforces strict verification boundaries in [`hecate_agent.core.grounding`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Core/hecate_agent/core/grounding.py) and [`hecate_runner.claim_provenance`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/claim_provenance.py):

1. **Source Evidence Extraction:** CTI text and primary web sources are parsed for exact regex matches against processes, command lines, hashes, IPs, domains, and registry keys.
2. **Verbatim Claim Auditing:** Any rule or hypothesis asserting that an attacker executed a specific artifact must have that artifact present in the verified source text; inferred techniques are explicitly labeled `grounding: inferred`.
3. **Platform Protects Heuristic:** Dual-use administrative tools (e.g. `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, `curl`) require specific malicious context or command-line parameters to avoid generating noisy, un-tunable detection rules.

### 4.3 Automated Reviewer & Self-Remediation Loop

In [`hecate_agent.agents.llm.sigma_generator`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Core/hecate_agent/agents/llm/sigma_generator.py) and [`hecate_runner.rule_tuner`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/rule_tuner.py):

1. **Syntactic Validation:** Every generated Sigma YAML rule is loaded into a strict AST parser to prevent invalid syntax or malformed YAML keys.
2. **Platform & Logsource Correction:** When a rule specifies an ambiguous platform or mismatched logsource (e.g. Linux auditd fields on a Windows process creation rule), the reviewer engine passes remediation error messages back to the LLM generator to regenerate corrected definitions.
3. **pySigma Backend Compatibility:** The rule is test-transpiled across all 5 target SIEM dialects. If a backend fails due to an unsupported condition modifier or wildcard placement, the rule is automatically tuned.

### 4.4 Purple-Team Telemetry Replay

In [`hecate_runner.purple_team`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/purple_team.py):
- For every generated hunt, Hecate simulates the adversary technique using Atomic Red Team definitions and synthetic telemetry generators.
- Synthesizes realistic events for:
  - **Process Creation:** Sysmon Event ID 1, Windows 4688, Linux auditd `execve`.
  - **File Operations:** Sysmon Event ID 11, auditd file write.
  - **Network Connections:** Sysmon Event ID 3, Zeek `conn.log`, Firewall logs.
  - **Web Application / WAF:** Apache/Nginx access logs and Cloudflare/ModSecurity WAF events.
- Evaluates candidate Sigma rules against the synthetic telemetry to verify true-positive detection prior to human submission.

### 4.5 Breach & Attack Simulation (BAS) & Live Adversary Emulation

In [`hecate_runner.bas`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas), Hecate implements automated **Level 4 Purple Teaming** by integrating with real-world adversary emulation frameworks:

        GATE["Promotion Policy<br/>bas_failed: review / block"]
    end

```

#### Core Components & Code Organization
- **Base Models & Safety Boundary ([`base.py`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas/base.py)):** Defines immutable Pydantic models (`DetonationRequest`, `DetonationResult`, `DetonationTarget`, `DetonationStage`, `VerificationStatus`, `DetectionVerificationResult`). Enforces non-negotiable safety guardrails: immediately raises `SafetyViolationError` if the target environment matches `production`, `prod`, or `live`, and verifies host and account allowlists.
- **MITRE CALDERA Connector ([`caldera.py`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas/caldera.py)):** Communicates with CALDERA servers via dual-API REST interaction (REST API v2 with automatic fallback to classic `/api/abilities`, `/api/agents`, and `/api/rest`). Resolves MITRE technique IDs to abilities, schedules autonomous ad-hoc operations, decodes base64 commands and output streams, detects early link completion, and cleans up adversaries and operations upon finish.
- **Platform-Aware Mock Fallback:** Disabled by default. Explicitly enabled fallbacks report `provider=mock` and carry fallback metadata; they are not live CALDERA execution evidence.
- **Stratus Red Team Connector ([`stratus.py`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas/stratus.py)):** Orchestrates cloud adversary emulation across AWS, GCP, and Azure using the `stratus-red-team` binary. Manages warm-up, detonation, telemetry event collection (CloudTrail, GCP Audit, Azure Activity), and mandatory resource destruction/cleanup.
- **Mock Provider ([`mock.py`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas/mock.py)):** Zero-dependency in-process provider generating deterministic, high-fidelity security telemetry (Sysmon process creation, network connections, file modifications, cloud audit events) for fast unit testing and offline CI/CD pipelines.
- **Detection Verifier ([`verifier.py`](file:///home/chemch/betas/Hecate-Runner/src/hecate_runner/bas/verifier.py)):** Executes closed-loop verification by evaluating candidate Sigma detection rules directly against the telemetry generated during detonation. Evaluates true-positive coverage, reports rule hit counts, and updates hunt markdown documents with verification metadata and frontmatter flags.
- **Hardened Agent Deployment:** The user service supervises an isolated nonroot Docker agent with no host mounts, read-only root, dropped capabilities, no new privileges, resource limits, and an internal network. CALDERA publishes its API only on loopback. User service mount settings alone were insufficient on the audited host; see [the BAS audit](BAS_SAFETY_AUDIT.md).

## 5. Security & Isolation Model

- **Zero-Unattended Execution:** The pipeline generates `status: planning` hunts and candidate queries. No query or remediation command is executed against production SIEMs without authenticated human confirmation.
- **Atomic Operations:** All file updates utilize atomic temporary-write-and-rename patterns (`atomic_write_text`) with flock guards to eliminate corruption risks during system interruptions.
- **Secret Isolation:** API tokens, GitHub App private keys, and SIEM credentials reside in secure `.env` files or `/run/secrets/` and are never committed to version control.
