## 2. In-Depth Subsystem Capabilities

### 2.1 CTI Ingestion & Multi-Feed Triage
Hecate integrates with more than 20 external intelligence sources without requiring third-party aggregation middleware:
- **Commercial & Community Feeds:** AlienVault OTX, MISP instances, OpenCTI, and CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV).
- **Specialized Threat Trackers:** Abuse.ch (ThreatFox, URLhaus), MalwareBazaar, VX-Underground, Shadowserver, VulnCheck, DFIR Report, and MSRC security advisories.
- **Infrastructure & C2 Telemetry:** Censys C2 scans, Certstream TLS certificate transparency logs, and Cloud Threat monitoring.
- **Local Feeds:** Manual file drops via `cti_queue/` for instant ad-hoc investigation.

### 2.2 Dual-Track Queue & Deterministic Bypass
To solve the dual challenges of high threat volume and LLM rate/quota limitations:
- **Fast Track (Sweeps):** Pure indicator feeds (e.g. malware hash lists, IP blocklists) are routed to the deterministic sweep engine. This generates valid, high-fidelity Sigma rules without calling external LLM APIs, operating with near-zero latency and zero token cost.
- **Deep Track (Research):** Complex narrative reports (e.g. DFIR incident analyses, Microsoft advisories) are allocated dedicated LLM context, conducting structured web research, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and multi-stage hypothesis generation.

### 2.3 Grounding Audit & Hallucination Mitigation
Detection rules in production cannot tolerate hallucinated command-line flags or fabricated IoCs:
- **Source Artifact Auditing:** Every extracted IP, domain, hash, filename, and registry path is verified against the raw intelligence document.
- **Strict Evidence Boundaries:** If a technique is inferred from general context rather than explicitly named, it is tagged as `grounding: inferred`, alerting human reviewers to verify telemetry availability.
- **Noise Suppression:** Built-in heuristics identify benign testing artifacts (e.g. loopback probes, mock lab scripts) and ensure dual-use utilities have required malicious flags before rules are approved.

### 2.4 Purple-Team Telemetry Replay & Emulation
Rather than assuming a generated detection rule works, Hecate tests it against synthetic telemetry:
- **Telemetry Replay:** Simulates attack telemetry corresponding to the hunt's MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- **Multi-Source Event Modeling:** Synthesizes realistic events for Windows Process Creation (Sysmon 1 / 4688), File Events (Sysmon 11), Network Connections (Sysmon 3 / Zeek), and Web/WAF events (Nginx / ModSecurity).
- **Rule Verification:** Evaluates candidate Sigma rules against the synthetic event log to verify that the query fires on malicious patterns and rejects normal baseline activity.

### 2.5 Live Adversary Emulation & Breach Simulation (BAS)
Level 4 Purple Teaming extends beyond synthetic replay into live autonomous adversary execution:
- **MITRE CALDERA Integration:** Connects via REST API with dual-version compatibility (v2 and classic endpoints) to resolve MITRE Technique IDs (e.g. `T1033`, `T1059.001`), schedules autonomous operations against allowlisted lab hosts, decodes base64 outputs, and triggers automatic cleanup.
- **Hardened Agent Deployment:** The user service supervises an isolated nonroot Docker agent with no host mounts, read-only root, dropped capabilities, no new privileges, resource limits, and an internal network. CALDERA publishes its API only on loopback. User service mount settings alone were insufficient on the audited host; see [the BAS audit](BAS_SAFETY_AUDIT.md).
- **Platform-Aware Mock Fallback:** Disabled by default. Explicitly enabled fallbacks report `provider=mock` and carry fallback metadata; they are not live CALDERA execution evidence.
- **Stratus Red Team Integration:** CLI wrapper executing attack procedures across AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes (e.g. `T1562.008` CloudTrail stop, `T1098.001` IAM access key creation, `T1530` S3 exfiltration, `T1610` privileged pod). Enforces a 3-stage lifecycle (`warmup` → `detonate` → `cleanup`) with guaranteed teardown.
- **Closed-Loop SIEM Verification:** Computes execution windows with clock drift and ingestion slack, verifies telemetry arrival, evaluates candidate Sigma detection queries, and surfaces blind spots (`DETECTION_MISS`, `TELEMETRY_MISS`) before PR promotion.
- **Deterministic Mock Provider:** Built-in in-memory simulator providing offline CI/CD and unit testing without cloud credentials or running CALDERA servers.
- **Promotion Policy Gates:** Incorporates BAS results into `promotion-policy.yaml`, enforcing human review or promotion blocking whenever an adversary detonation fails detection.
- **Strict Production Isolation:** Enforces host and account allowlisting, strictly rejecting execution against production environments (`production`, `prod`, `live`).

### 2.6 Multi-Engine Query Transpilation
Hecate translates generic Sigma detection rules into native, optimized query languages:
- **Splunk:** Search Processing Language (SPL).
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- **CrowdStrike Falcon:** Falcon LogScale Query Language.
- **Elasticsearch:** Event Query Language (EQL) and Lucene queries.
- **IBM QRadar:** Ariel Query Language (AQL).

### 2.7 Human-in-the-Loop ChatOps & Operations
- **Interactive Slack Cards:** When a hunt is drafted, Hecate posts an interactive Slack card displaying the hypothesis, confidence score, MITRE techniques, and candidate rules.
- **Thread Actions:** Security engineers can trigger queries, request rule tuning, or approve promotions directly from Slack threads.
- **Live Terminal Monitor:** Run `hecate-agent monitor` in any terminal to see a real-time curses-based view of daemon activity, queue status, and active research cycles.
